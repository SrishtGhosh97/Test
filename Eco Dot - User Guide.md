## ALEXA IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY
### 1. Wake word and indicators

Alexa does not begin listening until your Echo device detects the wake word (for example, “Alexa”). A blue light lets you know when the audio is being sent to Amazon’s secure cloud. 
### 2. Microphone Controls

You can electronically disconnect the microphones with the press of a button. 
### 3. Voice History

Want to know exactly what Alexa heard? You can view and delete your voice recordings in the Alexa app at any time. 
## SETUP DEVICE

On your phone or tablet, download and install the latest version of the Alexa app from your app store. 
Note: before setting up your device, have your Wi-FI network name and password ready. 
2. Plug in your Echo Dot

Plug your Echo Dot into an electrical socket using the included power adaptor. A blue light ring will spin around the bottom. In about a minute, Alexa will greet you and let you know to complete setup in the Alexa app. 
3. Set up your Echo Dot in the Alexa app

Open the Alexa app to set up your Echo Dot. Log in with an existing Amazon account username and password, or create a new account. If you aren’t prompted to set up your device after opening the Alexa app, tap the More icon to add your device manually. 
The app helps you get more out of your Echo Dot. It’s where you set up calling and messaging, manage music, lists, settings and news.
